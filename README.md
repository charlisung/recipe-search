# Recipe App üßë‚Äçüç≥

This is a recipe app built with react. Users can search food keyword to get recipes. Recipes are fetched from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

I built this app when I was pretty new to react. I was really confused back then and now I understand why I was so confused... My codes were confusing...

Refactoring this code, I realize I have to really plan out how I'm gonna structure future app.

## Lessons Learned

- Write codes that you will understand and refactor later!

## Future Challenges

- When a user search a keyword, app should redirect to `/search?q={keyword}`
